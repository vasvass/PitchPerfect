# PitchPerfect
Udacity iOS Nanodegree first project

Udacity's description:
The first step in becoming an iOS Developer is to create your first app! 
Pitch Perfect provides a substantial, while not overly complicated, introduction to the iOS ecosystem.

- Create a new project from existing iOS app templates
- Add buttons, images, labels and create user interfaces for the app using the Storyboard
- Leverage the Model View Controller (MVC) design principles; this includes writing custom model code, and using UIViewController, and UIView
- Create Outlet and Action connections between the views and view controllers. Benefit from the power of Delegates by using them in code
- Navigate between two scenes in the app using UINavigationController
- Play audio files using AVFoundation’s AVAudioEngine class
- Run the iOS simulator and download the app on a physical device
- Search documentation, resolve bugs, and read other people’s code
